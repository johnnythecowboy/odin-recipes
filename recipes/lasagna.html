    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese.</p>
    <p>This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.</p>

   <p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups
    <li>1 large egg
    <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese
    <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
    <li>½ teaspoon salt
    <li>¼ tsp pepper
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil
    <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced
    <li>¾ lb. ground beef
    <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced
    <li>½ cup chicken broth
    <li>40 oz. marinara sauce, see notes
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste
    <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce
    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
    </ul>

   <p><h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
    <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
    <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.
    <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°.
    <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.
    <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.
    <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.
    <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.
    <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.
    <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.
    <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.
    <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.
    <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.
    <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.
